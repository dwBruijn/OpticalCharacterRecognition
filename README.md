# OpticalCharacterRecognition
Machine Learning Project: Building a Neural Network from scratch and training it to perform Character Recognition using Back Propagation.  
The network is first trained using a training set of lowercase characters. The testing set consits of images that contain paragraphs written in a monospaced font. Characters within each paragraph will be recognized by the trained neural network.
